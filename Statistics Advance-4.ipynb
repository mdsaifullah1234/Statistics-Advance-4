    "Answer = In statistics, a confidence interval is a range of values that is likely to contain an unknown population parameter. It is calculated at a designated confidence level, which is the percentage of times that the interval would contain the true population parameter if we were to repeat the experiment or re-sample the population many times. The most common confidence levels are 95% and 99%.\n",

    "How to calculate a confidence interval\n",
